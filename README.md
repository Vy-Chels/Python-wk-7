# Python-wk-7
# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

This project analyzes the famous Iris dataset using Python, pandas, and matplotlib/seaborn.

## What This Project Does

1. **Loads and Explores the Iris Dataset**
   - Shows the first 5 rows of data
   - Displays data types and structure
   - Checks for missing values

2. **Performs Basic Data Analysis**
   - Calculates basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
   - Shows species distribution
   - Computes mean measurements for each species
   - Analyzes correlations between features

3. **Creates Four Different Visualizations**
   - Line Chart: Shows how measurements change across samples
   - Bar Chart: Compares mean measurements across different species
   - Histogram: Shows the distribution of sepal lengths by species
   - Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between sepal length and petal length

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis Script**
   ```bash
   python iris_analysis.py
   ```

3. **View the Results**
   - Check the console for statistical analysis results
   - Open 'iris_analysis.png' to see all visualizations

## Required Packages
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Project Structure
